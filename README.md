# sillydebugger

## What? 

sillydebugger a simple and silly 'debugger' that I wrote whilst playing around
with cache as ram stuff. The current goal is to get this working without
needing any ram at all, having everything in rom, cache, or other silly
locations.

## Why?

For fun, why not? I know there's numerous better ways to debug my bios project
but I was having fun with this project so I thought I'd stick with it for a
while longer at least.

## What works?

Currently, not a lot. You can single-step through simple 16-bit 
programs that don't do branching, and that's about it.

## TODO:

all of it? 
 - get rid of need for ram present, we still do most our stuff in ram
 - branching, conditionals, ...
 - ui improvements
 - memory manipulation commands
 - breakpoints?
 - ability to continue for N cycles instead of just single steps
